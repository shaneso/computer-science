How to write a great research paper
by Simon Peyton Jones, Microsoft Research

- Title (make it catchy but specific and clear)

- Abstract (4 sentences; usually written last)
  - State the problem
  - Say why it's an interesting problem
  - Say what your solution achieves
  - Say what follows from your solution

- Introduction (1 page)
  - Describe the problem
    - Concrete examples can be used to
      help give shape to the problem
  - State your contributions
    - Write the list of contributions first
    - The list of contributions drives the entire paper:
      the paper substantiates the claims you have made
    - Reader thinks "wow, if they really can deliver this,
      that'll be exciting; I'd better read on"
    - Use forward references from the narrative in intro

- The problem (1 page)
  - Introduce the problem and the idea using examples
    and only then present the general case

- My idea (2 pages)
  - Explain it as if you were speaking to someone
    using a whiteboard
  - Conveying the intuition is primary, not secondary
  - Once your reader has the intuition, he/she can follow
    the details (but not vice versa)
  - Even if he/she skips the details, he/she still takes
    away something valuable

- The details (5 pages; evidence)
  - Your introduction makes claims
  - Body of paper provides evidence to support each claim
  - Check each claim in intro, identify evidence, and then
    forward reference it from the claim
  - Evidence can be: analysis and comparison, theorems,
    measurements, case studies

- Related work (1-2 pages)
  - Compare your work with others
  - Present your work's strengths and weaknesses

- Conclusions and further work (0.5 pages)
  - Be brief
  - For future work, say what you intend to do

- Help
  - Have your paper read by as many friendly guinea pigs
    as possible
  - Experts are good
  - Non-experts are also very good
  - Each reader can only read your paper for the first time
    once! So use them carefully
  - Explain carefully what you want ("I got lost here" is
    much more important than "Jarva is mis-spelt")

- Expert help
  - When you think you're done, send the draft to the
    competition saying "could you help me ensure that I
    describe your work fairly?"
  - Often they will respond with helpful critique (they
    are interested in the area)
  - They are likely to be your referees anyway, so getting
    their comments or criticism up front is good

- Review
  - Treat every review like gold dust
  - Desire criticism and accept praise
